My experience extends to feature design, requirements analysis, and technical design, ensuring that I bring a holistic perspective to every project.

🔄 Refactoring & Optimization: I'm passionate about maintaining code quality and optimizing for performance. Refactoring is more than just a task for me; it's a way to enhance the user experience and make codebases more efficient.

🛠️ Diverse Tech Stack: While my primary expertise lies in React and TypeScript, I'm not limited to one stack. I've successfully worked with various technologies, including Vue, Angular, and AngularJS, when project demands required them.

🧑‍💼 Leadership Skills: As a Team Lead, I've collaborated closely with project managers, assisted in work planning, and played a pivotal role in feature prioritization.
